    <p>Slack offers chat rooms organized by topic, private groups,
    and direct messaging capabilities to facilitate conversation and help
    your team get things done. All content inside Slack is searchable,
    including files, conversations, and people, so it's easy to stay organized.
    Integration with several third-party services allows use of their
      features directly within your Slack discussions.</p>

      <p>What’s New</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From today, you'll notice a shiny new app button that matches our new logo. You can read more about it on our blog at SlackHQ.com. Change! Everyone loves it. (Having said that, nothing about Slack or how you use it has changed. Just the button.)</li>
      </ul>		
      <p>Bug Fixes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users signing in with Single Sign-On would see the same message twice when logging in.</li>
        <li>Users signing in with Single Sign-On would see the same message twice when logging in. This will not happen any more.</li>
	<li>When trying to select a portion of a code-formatted block of text (text formatted with ` or ``` at either end), some characters were proving slippery and hard to select. No more.</li>
	<li>The desktop app was not playing nicely with the glibc 2.28. If you were experiencing a segfault, you should segfault no more. It's better now.</li>
	<li>The full screen shortcut was mistakenly listed as ‘Ctrl+F’ instead of ‘Ctrl+Shift+F’ in the "View" menu. We both apologize for this and also hope that, because of it, someone out there discovered 'Ctrl+F' is a useful shortcut for searching the channel that you're in. Always look on the bright side of bugs.
</li>
      </ul>

    <release date="2018-10-02" version="3.3.3">
      <description>
      <ul>
        <li>All updates are important, of course. This one contains security updates, and as we know, they’re the most important kind of all.</li>
      </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release date="2018-08-31" version="3.3.1">
      <description>
      <ul>
        <li>Overall, stability has been improved, thanks to a veritable bevy of bugfixes. </li>
        <li>It's so very useful when you report issues that we've tweaked the diagnostics that collect reports so that we can get to them, and to things being better for you, sooner. </li>
        <li>There was an annoying flickering caused by the color profiles having been updated in 3.2.0. There is, as far as we can tell, no more flicker.</li>
        <li>When you download something, we will now more dependably tell you so.</li>
        <li>Duplicate windows were leading to dubious repetitious notifications if multiple instances of the aforementioned were open simultaneously. We've fixed them so that the overt duplicity of multiplicities no longer incurs incongruity. TL;DR: No more doublespeak. If you have multiple windows open, you'll now only be notified once. </li>
        <li>We’ve tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.</li>
      </ul>

    <release date="2018-05-31" version="3.2.1">
      <description>
      <ul>
        <li>If you use Red Hat, you now have spell check. For other distros, you have a new and different spellchecker. Hopefully it is better at detecting what language you are writing in. Hopefully.</li>
